React color picker app.
An app to test out react native, which copies something I've seen a lot of people doing,
sliders that change the background color.

In order to test the app you need to have react native.

- Install here: [React-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
- Run npm Install
- Run react-native run-ios
